      <h3>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.</h3>
    </div>
    
    <p>I am a Thinkful student living in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
    <div>
      <p>In addition to studying with Thinkful, I enjoy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hanging out with my wife & our dog</li>
          <li>Playing drums & guitar</li>
          <li>Exercising & enjoying all the outdoor activities our city has to offer</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>About me</h3>
  </div> 
 <p>Being a touring musician I found that I was often away from home! I also realized I had lots of downtime on the road, and lots of friends who always seemed to need help with their websites. Then a lightbulb went off in my head...</p>
      
    <p>I am really enjoying learning about sofware & web development with <a href="http://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>! Someday soon I know I'll be able to apply my skills to a careeer that can both challenge & excite me, all while being able to help some friends out along the way.</p>
